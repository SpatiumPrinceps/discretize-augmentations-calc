# discretize-augmentations-calc

Code that is used to calculate the augmentations on [discretize.eu](https://discretize.eu/augmentations) for the game Guild Wars 2. 

The initial code for this was written by Saule (Discord: Saule#4463) in C. Since the website is built with react Princeps rewrote the program to be executable in js, hence the strange looking code bits and redundancy. 

# Setup 
```
$ npm install 
$ http-server 
Navigate to localhost:8080
```
